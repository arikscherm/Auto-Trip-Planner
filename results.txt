Cascade Divide Road is open When the road is passable. You may stay 14 days at Cascade Divide Road. Submitted by Anonymous. Last update: Jun 16, 2015Free, dispersed camping for the length of this road.  Located north of Durango behind Durango Mountain Resort. This area is suggested by the forest service. RVs scout ahead. 
Dispersed camping and car camping outside of developed campgrounds is allowed within 300 feet of open forest roads, unless posted otherwise. Please observe all signs, pack out all of your trash and use caution with campfires. Try to use existing pull-offs and campsites that have obviously been used before to limit your impacts.
Dispersed camping is a great way to enjoy the experience of camping away from developed campgrounds. Dispersed camping means there are none of the amenities you will find at a developed campground. There are no picnic tables, drinking water, or toilets available.

Submitted by Anonymous. Last update: Jun 19, 2015You can boondock anywhere on the entire five miles of Lime Creek Road. Free camping. The first spot on the south side is very easy to get to and has room for any sized rig. After that, take caution. The road is considered a 4x4 route though it is rarely used. High clearance is a must if you want to do the entire route. There is plenty of dispersed camping along Lime Creek Road.

The road in is Dirt. Upper Hermosa Road is open in the summer. There are 16-29 campsites at this location. You may stay two weeks at Upper Hermosa Road. Submitted by hitekhomeless. Last update: Jul 7, 2015Dispersed, free camping along forestry road 578 in the San Juan National forest of Colorado. There is a "campground" on this road on the same name. It's really just an area around a vault toilet. However, there are a lot of places to boondock out side of the campgrounds. The early parts of the road would make me uneasy in a big RV, but there were tons of them camping in the area.
This area is very busy. However, the existing campsites are well spaced. So if you get a spot, it should be a good one. The first campsites are within walking distance to the creek but some of those walk are incredibly vertical. Near the last bend, as you head into the canyon, the campsites become creekside.
We had bursty 3G verizon, with amp and external ant, signal all the way up until the Upper Hermosa campground. No ATT.

The road in is Dirt and 11 miles miles from a paved road. Barlow Creek Road is open in the summer. There are 6-15 campsites at this location. You may stay 14 days at Barlow Creek Road. Submitted by hitekhomeless. Last update: Jul 7, 2015Free, dispersed camping in the San Juan National Forest. True boondocking. We encountered numerous dispersed campsites along this road and we only went to just the other side of Corral Creek, about 1.5 miles. At one mile, there is a sign saying the road is unsuitable for trailers. 
All but the first campsite had creek access. The first one is right as you turn on to this road at the fork. It is high on an overlook. The rest are in open fields next to the tree line and creeks.
We fell in love with the campsite at our turn around point. It was were Corral Creek and Hermosa Creek converge. The last half mile of road to it was pretty rough. We wouldn't have driven our big truck camper on it.
Really, I am surprised so many people bring large rigs this far out. The road is a one lane mountain road. I wouldn't want to meet another trailer on it, but I guess it's old hat for them.
Being dispersed camping, it's just you and nature. Real boondocking. No facilities. You are on your own. Bring everything you'll need (water, toilet, shovel, etc.). Take out everything you brought.
Zero cellular service. We tried both ATT and Verzion with an amplifier and 8db external antenna.
Directions
Head north on Purgatory Blvd from hwy 550. Don't get sucked into the ski resort at 0.5mi, keep tracking north. Purgatory Blvd becomes Hermosa Park Rd. Turn left onto Forest Rd 578/Hermosa Park Rd at about 3.5mi. Continue to follow Forest Rd 578, past the ski slopes, past lots of dispersed camping, past the campground, for nearly 7.45mi. Turn right onto Barlow Creek Road

Many wouldn't want to drive an RV on these roads, but while narrow, they are well maintained and there is plenty of room to turn around at the top of the mountain (8mi of dirt, mountain road)

Golden Horn Primitive Campground is open in the summer. The maximum RV length at Golden Horn Primitive Campground is unlimited. You may stay two weeks at Golden Horn Primitive Campground. Submitted by Anonymous. Last update: Jun 16, 2015This is one of a handful of designated dispersed camping areas along South Mineral Creek - San Juan National Forest. The others are Kendall, Anvil, and Sultun. All are free.  Primitive fire rings and vault toilets. No other facilities or services. No reservations. Boondoocking.
Camping outside of designated areas is forbidden on FR 585 and FR 815 (Clear Lake).
The creek is polluted with mine drainage so it\'s probably not a good idea to wade in it or to allow your pets to go in it.
Rangers enforce the 14 day limit.

The road in is Dirt and .01 miles from a paved road. There are 6-15 campsites at this location. You may stay 7 days out of 30 at Lizard Head Pass Dispersed Camping. Submitted by Karen. Last update: Jun 28, 2013 This is an opened meadow with gorgeous 360 degree views of forest and rocky mountain peaks. We didn't drive around the whole area but from Google Earth it looks like there's one big loop road. The road is dirt with some big holes and ruts. It'll be slick when it's wet. 
 The spots where people camp are big enough for any RV but check the condition of the road before attempting to drive up the hill. It's steeper than it looks in the pictures.I recommend a high clearance vehicle but when we camped there a big class A had managed to get up to one of the higher spots.
 There's an interpretative site and trail head across Hwy 145 where you could probably stay for the night if the dirt road looks too bad.
 Camping is limited to 7 days in a 30 day period.

Last update: Jun 24, 2013 This is a very popular dispersed camping site.It's just a few miles from Silverton, Colorado with miles of 4x4 roads and old mining towns to explore. 
 Turn off of US 550 onto FR 585 at the sign for the national forest campground. A developed campground is located four miles down the road but free dispersed camping is allowed at designated sites. This site is about .75 of a mile in, clearly marked with a sign with the rules. Camping is under pine trees or in a large, opened, river rock area close to the creek. There's a vault toilet but no tables or trash collection.
 The creek is polluted with mine drainage so it's probably not a good idea to wade in it or to allow your pets to go in it.

Great spots right on the water! Great primitive camping with fire rings. The water is fast moving and beautiful. Across the Animas River, you can see an old mine with equipment still in it. I look forward to fireworks on the 4th!

The road is a bit rough. Garbage left from last campers

Submitted by Anonymous. Last update: Jul 16, 2015The forest service MVUM says that the entire length of this forest road (678) is OK for dispersed camping. There are a few spots within a 1/2 mile of 550. Small rigs suggested. There is a "No Trailers Beyond This Point" sign at the first switchback. There are also some spots, which are better for larger rigs (not huge), near the power plant on the south side of the bridge on 550.
You can also camp on 820 which shoots north of this road at the first switchback. However, there aren't any places to camp on 820 until you are out of the trees. The portion through the trees is truly one lane and steep to climb. The trailhead for the Columbine Trail is in the treed area. Anyway, the point is, if you want to camp on 820, it's better to come from north side of 820. There is one campsite on the road side of the stream. We saw a fifth wheel parked there. To get to other campsites, you must ford the creek. They are small, turnout style campsites that have great views and might do in a pinch but are really exposed and undesirable. Don't take your RV on 820 between Ophir road and the creek.
