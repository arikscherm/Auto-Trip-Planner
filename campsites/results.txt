The road in is Dirt. Durfield BLM Boondocking is open May 1 to Nov 30. There are 1-5 campsites at this location and the maximum RV length is 35 feet. You may stay two weeks at Durfield BLM Boondocking. Submitted by Anonymous. Last update: Sep 4, 2020A couple of free dispersed camping spots just south of highway 160 between Durango and Bayfield.
Important: Do not follow your GPS. It will try to route you through private property, which is incorrect and, even worse, there isn't a place to turn around down that road. Access to the BLM is directly off of Hwy 160 @ 37.226515, -107.695034. There is a gate with a BLM sign. 9.4mi east of Durango Home Depot
The marker is on the best campsite that I found. It's high and dry, well off the road and partly shaded. I think that a big rig could do it, but I don't have one so...
The dirt roads through the area were in great condition. The area is littered with natural gas wells. You may not camp in those, but they make a great spot to turn around.
4GLTE - I could see the towers just across highway 160
No other facilities. No water, toilets, or reservations. Pack it in -> pack it out.

Submitted by Anonymous. Last update: Jun 16, 2015Dispersed camping along this road begins at 3.6 miles in, the southern tip of the first switchback. Except for a small portion (mile 6.8 to 9) you are allowed to boondock the whole length of this road (Missionary Ridge Road/FR682. Probably not a wise camping area for RVs. Keep it small.

Take La Plata Canyon Rd 5 miles north into the National Forest. I have not stayed here, and I missed it while researching the campsites to the north. It is on the San Juan Forest's Motor Vehicle Use Map. I can see campers there on google satellite maps. 
No services of any kind but there are fire grates and defined areas for camping. The 40 foot rigs cannot get in.

The road in is Dirt and 100 Yards miles from a paved road. Cherry Creek Gravel Pit is open Whenever not blocked by snow. There are 6-15 campsites at this location and the maximum RV length is unlimited. You may stay 14 Days at Cherry Creek Gravel Pit. Submitted by DLTooley. Last update: Jul 26, 2016This is an easy to access spot just West of Durango. Look for the sign 'Cherry Creek Forest Access' just East of the Escalante Wayside - it does come up fast.

The road is a little bit rough, but should be okay for most rigs - the condition can be viewed satisfactorily from the access point. This is a large gravel pit used for construction of the Highway - though it is still close to the road it is cut back enough so that the noise is barely noticeable. This is more of a quality passing through space, say for the night before a town day in Durango, than a place you'd want to stay for several days. There are however are a couple very nice spots up higher though the access is very rough and steep. This road does make for a great hike, accessing the level railroad grade in half mile or so.

Decent place to camp. A handful of the sites are ideal for pulling a truck or van in to sleep, some are better for tents. There are sites that you can't see, where you walk in a bit to camp. Once you get a few miles up into the aspens, the road starts to get a little rougher. Beautiful views higher up. There is a national forest camp ground a mile up the highway that is closer to the road and 18 bucks a night. This is quieter and more remote.

The road in is Gravel and 2-6 miles from a paved road. Madden Peak Road (Durango, CO) is open When snow allows. There are 6-15 campsites at this location. You may stay 16 days at Madden Peak Road (Durango, CO). Submitted by Anonymous. Last update: Aug 14, 2013West of Durango, go North on the road marked "Forest Access: Madden Peak Road). Note your mileage as you turn off the highway... The road goes through private property, where you CAN NOT stop. Once you cross the Forest Service boundary, you will be on FS Road 316. Approx 1 mile from the highway (just after entering National Forest), you will come to a crossroad, which gives you two options. FS 316 continues straight, and has several good places within the next 1-2 miles. You will notice the little turn-offs to some that are set back from the road in the flat areas. The road continues across the mountain, but becomes steep after the first mile or so, with no real campsites.  At the crossroads you can also turn right onto FS 568. About 500 yards down, there is a turnoff to the left that leads to 2 good RV sites. 50 feet further, a turn-off to the right has 3 good sites. The first of these is a huge space where you could put 2-3 RVs and a tent or two. The third has a better view, but is smaller and would only fit one RV or a couple of tents, and has less turn-around room. If you do not stop at one of these areas, TURN AROUND at this point. The road continues about another mile, then is fenced and abruptly becomes a bike trail, and there is no where to turn a rig around. You'd have to back out that mile of semi-winding road.

You may stay two weeks at FR528 Sauls Creek Area. Submitted by Anonymous. Last update: Jul 11, 2015Free dispersed camping just east of Bayfield in the San Juan National Forest. There are about a eight well used campsites in this area. There are even more slightly used and suitable boondocking spots. I don't think a big rig would have trouble getting to and from the first spot at the junction of 755B (first left). Otherwise, they should send a scout. There are no through roads. Each of them dead end to a gate, most with a natural gas well behind the gate. Lots of trails in the area.  Open meadows and tall pines. Free roaming cows and probably some bears.
