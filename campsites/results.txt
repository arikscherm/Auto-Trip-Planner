Submitted by GypsytheVan. Last update: Mar 25, 2020Really nice, quiet Walmart parking lot that allows overnight stays. We stayed here 3 nights in a row and loved it. There is a specific parking area for overnight stays in Parking Lot A in the white parking lines. The Walmart is not 24 hrs and no fresh produce but there is a nice Hannaford's nearby for that stuff. Wifi and washrooms in the Walmart.

The road in is Dirt. Submitted by Maryse_dion@live.ca. Last update: May 18, 2018There are spots available on the road by the river. Because it was a bit muddy in May, we decided to explore a bit and went up the next road on the right, going toward the park rather than toward Granville. The road doesn't appear on Google maps. Going up you will face a pretty broken road, didn't attempt with our SUV but you can skip it on the left side and there right after you'll find plenty of space to pitch a tent. We sleep in our SUV. Would also work for a van, small RV I would think! Count about 2 minutes to go up, it's not far. Nice view on the mountains and there is at least 2 fire pits.

The road in is Dirt and Half mile to paved road miles from a paved road. The maximum RV length at Lake Willoughby (hike-in) is 15 feet. Submitted by MarriedGoRound. Last update: Oct 20, 20212020: Please note that bicycles are ONLY allowed on gravel surfaced roads (the CCC Road, Duck Pond Road) within Willoughby State Forest and NOT on hiking trails.
There are no designated camping sites within the forest and no facilities other than the portable toilet units at the South End during the summer and the unit at the CCC Road trailhead year-round. Car camping or RV camping is NOT allowed at Willoughby State Forest. Only primitive camping may take place within the Forest. Camping near the lake is NOT an allowed use.
2017: Free campsite on CCC Rd off of south end of Lake Willoughby on 5A. The entrance is across from Mt. Pisgah trail head. Beautiful view of Lake Willoughby. No firering but there are rocks previously laid out. Looks like people have been using this site. Big enough for 2 Class B campers but more more. Not ideal for tent but doable, it would be open and close to the road. No bathroom and water access.

Last update: Sep 27, 2012We stopped at the library to charge up and use the internet and we stumbled upon an overnight parking area in the parking lot. The sign says: Cars that have been parked for longer than 72 hours will be towed. We stayed there a night and we had no troubles with the cops or anything. Near a river and bridge, low lighting, pretty quiet, and I felt safe there. It's not an "official" campsite, but if you're discreet in your car or RV you shouldn't have any troubles.
You'll see the library and the parking lot is UNDER the bridge. Exact coordinates: 44.012155,-73.16835
